# Nutritionix__

## Actually writing a read me for the first time so I remember what this is :)__

### Main Goal__
Nutritionix's goal is to create a simple to read easy to use website which uses some government or otherwise nutritional data API to grab the nutrition to them be able to combine and create "diets" for each user and show the nutritional information through a label or some kind of neat table.__

### Improvement Checklist__
Proper css__
Use '~~anime~~' <-- doesn't work well with react from experience, libraries are difficult to use and create cascading div problems so find another? 'React-Spring' seems promising to do animations of CSS
Explore other packages I can use with react perhaps 'Redux', 'Joi', Etc to be found and added onto later__
Try not to use past React scripts and adapt to new changes if there are any present__
Switch over to or start with Node JS for the backend of the project
Create a timeline of diets if the plan deviates day by day__
Add custom ingredients which are saved per user since from experience many government API lack all the ingredients__
Possibly add in dishes as well though this seems extremely unlikely as all dishes are cooked differently? perhaps a usage of food delivery such as hellofresh or fast food chains?__
'Finish a project for once'
